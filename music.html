                <h1>Music Projects</h1><br>
		<p>I love music and it has been an important part of my life since before I can remember. My main instruments are the guitar, drums, bass, and ukelele. I have recently come into
		learning music production, and I am taking piano lessons on the Grinnell campus. My passion for music comes not only from my joy of listening, but the fresh
		and unique experience of playing with others. Our on campus group, Freesound, fosters this sentiment by providing means for students to meet and perform. My goal
		in music is to play, write, and perform as much as I can.</p><br><br><br><br>

                <p class="lead"><strong>Production</strong></p>
		<p>Over the summer I became interested in producing tracks. In order to learn how to use the production software (Ableton) I spent the end of the summer making a
		rudimental beat mixtape. Not only was I able to learn about production, but I was also able to make beats for my friends and I who are avid freestylers.</p>

		<p>Above are three of my favorite beats from my mixtape "Trial & Error"<br>
		I hope to expand my productions beyond freestyle beats to other genres. Stay tuned!</p><br><br><br><br>

                <p class="lead"><strong>The Current Jam</strong></p>
		<p>Blow My High - Kendrick Lamar (cover)</p>
		<p>Warning: Some explicit lyrics!</p>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SgsB9345tu8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>This jam is special in that it is spontaneous. I was relaxing and making dinner with friends when we received the good news.
		At the conclusion of their training, my friends Richard and Anita, were hired as members of the technology consultant corporation
		that I work for. Noah, on the ukelele, and I, in our excitment, began to play a song for them upon recieving the news.
		What I enjoy is that we didn't rehearse this or plan on being joined by Phillip on vocals halfway through. 
		Even more interesting, was the song we played (Blow My High), has a chorus that sounds reminiscent of "RIP Anita".</p><br>

		<p><strong>Sorry for the profanity of the lyrics! (It's in the nature of the song)</strong></p><br><br><br>
